Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

SOLUTION:
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS NAME_LENGTH
FROM STATION
WHERE LENGTH(CITY) = (SELECT MIN(LENGTH(CITY)) FROM STATION)
ORDER BY CITY
LIMIT 1;

SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS NAME_LENGTH
FROM STATION
WHERE LENGTH(CITY) = (SELECT MAX(LENGTH(CITY)) FROM STATION)
ORDER BY CITY
LIMIT 1;
